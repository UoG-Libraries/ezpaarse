# Middlewares #

## What's a middleware ? ##

Middlewares are functions that constitute the processing chain. The middlewares are successively applied to the consultation events processed by ezPAARSE and turnthem into the definitive form they will have when the events are eventually written in the result file.

## How to create a middleware ? ##

The middlewares have their own repository.Please refer to the [Readme](https://github.com/ezpaarse-project/ezpaarse-middlewares) for more details.

## How to load a middleware ? ##

To become part of the processing chain, a middleware must have its name (ie the name of its file without the `.js`) added to the `EZPAARSE_MIDDLEWARES` array in the config file. The order of declaration in the array determines the order in which middlewares are called.
