# IP addresses domains filtering #

ezPAARSE uses various filters to reduce the noise generated by non pertinent log lines.

## Excluding the robots' accesses ##
By default, a list of IP addresses is used to recognize and exclude the accesses made by robots (spiders, indexing robots, etc.)
The log lines generated by such accesses are rejected.

To complete the robots' list, you just have to create a file in the `exclusions` folder. Its name has to start with `robots.`, and must contain one IP address per line.

## Excluding arbitrary IP addresses ##
It is also possible to voluntarily filter out some IP addresses. This covers the use case where a training session occurs and we don't want to count those accesses.
The matched lines are rejected in a distinct file from the robots rejects.

To complete this list, you just have to create a file in the `exclusions` folder and its name must start with `hosts.`, and contain one IP address per line.

## The unrelevant domains ##
Accesses to proxied domains that are of no interest for you (because they are not relevant to the electronic ressources you need to trace) can also be filtered out. That will help slim down the rate of rejected lines.

To complete this domains list, you just have to create a file in the `exclusions` folder and its name must start with `domains.`, and contain one IP address per line.
