# Alerts #

## Principles ##
When you process log files with ezPAARSE, a number of processing indicators are generated: number of log lines read, of rejects, of recognized platforms, etc.). Those indicators can be used to detect anomalies during the processing, based on figures considered as "normal".

## How to know if alerts have been generated? ##
The list of alerts is available in the [processing report](./report.html#alerts). If the mail notification is activated, you'll also be able to access this list in the mail sent when the processing is finished.

**NB**: the activation of the alert system needs a sufficient quantity of relevant log lines. The activation threshold is set in the `config.json` file, with the `activationThreshold` key. It can also be modified with the **Alerts-Activation-Threshold** header.

##Â Available alerts ##

### Unknown domains ###
Generated when a domain frequently appears in the log lines but no associated parser has been found. The presence rate is calculated with the sum of relevant log lines.

```
  appearance_rate = appearance_sum / (total_of_loglines - ignored_lines) * 100
```

The activation threshold is set in the `config.json` file, with the `unknownDomainsRate` key. It can also be modified with the **Alerts-Unknown-Domains-Rate** header.

### Holes in the knowledges bases ###

#### Lack of a knowledge base ####
An alert is generated when the absence of a PKB prevents the enrichment of Consultation Events carrying a provider' identifier (title_id).

#### Lack of an identifier  ####
An alert is generated when an identifier is lacking and has been repeatedly requested.

The activation threshold is set in the `config.json` file, with the `titleIdOccurrenceRate` key. It can also be modified with the **Alerts-TitleID-Occurrence-Rate** header.

#### General lack ####
An alert is generated when a large number of searches in a PKB have proved unsuccessful..

The tolerated rate of unsuccessful searches is set in the `config.json` file, with the `pkbFailRate` key. It can also be modified with the **Alerts-PKB-Fail-Rate** header.
