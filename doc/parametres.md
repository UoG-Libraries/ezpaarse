### Response-Encoding ###
Encoding of the data sent back by server. *(supported : gzip, deflate)*  

### Accept ###
Output format. Supported :
  - text/csv (by default)
  - text/tab-separated-values (for a TSV output : as CSV but tab-delimited)
  - application/json
  - application/jsonstream (one JSON object per line)

### Log-Format-xxx ###
Format of the log lines in input, depend on the proxy *xxx* used. [See the available formats](./formats.html)

### Date-Format ###
Date format used in the logs sent. Default is : 'DD/MMM/YYYY:HH:mm:ss Z'.  

### Crypted-Fields ###
Comma-separated list of fields that will be crypted in the results, or `none` to disable crypting. Defaults to `host,login`.

**Caution**: each job uses a random salt for crypting, so crypted values from different jobs are not comparable.

### Output-Fields ###
To specify the fields to include in the output (if the format allows it). [(More information)](./outputfields.html)  

### Traces-Level ###
Allows to specify the verbosity level desired for ezPAARSE's feedback. The higher levels include the lower ones.
Niveaux disponibles :
  - **error** : blocking errors, abnormal treatment termination.  
  - **warn** : errors not fatal to the treatment.  
  - **info** : general informations (requested format, ending notification, number of ECs generated...).  
  - **verbose** : more precise than info, gives more information about each stage of the treatment.  
  - **silly** : every detail of the treatment (parser not found, line ignored, unsuccessful search in a pkb...).  


### Reject-Files ###
List of the reject files to create, separated by commas. (`none` by default, `all`)
Possible values : Unknown-Formats, Ignored-Domains, Unknown-Domains, Unqualified-ECs, PKB-Miss-ECs, Duplicate-ECs, Unordered-ECs, Filtered-ECs, Ignored-Hosts, Robots-ECs.

### User-field[n]-xxx ###

### Response-Charset ###
Character map used for output. [(see supported encodings)](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite#supported-encodings).

### Max-Parse-Attempts ###
Maximum number of lines that ezPAARSE will attempt to parse in order to check the log format.

### Clean-Only ###
If set to `true`, ezPAARSE will just filter out the lines we are sure are irrelevant and output only the relevant ones.
The goal when using this parameter is to reduce the size of the log file, if you need to store it for further treatment.

### Force-Parser ###
If URLs don't have 'domain' part, use this parameter to force right parser to be used. Usefull for Open Access log analysis which don't have domain part in URL (all URLs comes form the same domain).
For example : Force-Parser: 'dspace'.
Can be use in conjonction with Force-ECField-Publisher.
