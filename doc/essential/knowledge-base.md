## What is a knowledge base? ##
A **PKB** (read _Publisher Knowledge Base_) is a list making the link between normaized metadata (eg. ISSN, DOI, journal title, etc.) and proprietary resource identifier used by a vendor.

A **PKB** is composed of one or more [tab separed value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) text files and conform to the [KBART format](http://www.niso.org/workrooms/kbart)

The KBART field named **title_id** represents the vendor's identifier that will be linked to a normalized identifier like **print_identifier** (very often: print ISSN) or **online_identifier**.

The KBART file used by ezPAARSE can contain additional non-KBART fields (that will be prefixed with pkb-, like for example: pkb-domain), depending on the richness of the metadata available.

To be taken in account by ezPAARSE, the PKB files need to respect the KBART nomenclature: **[ProviderName]\_*[Region/Consortium]*\_[PackageName]\_[YYYY-MM-DD].txt**, and be located in a folder named after the platform (eg.: **sd** for ScienceDirect).

Examples :
cairn/cairn_ebooks_2014-02-13.txt
cairn/cairn_journals_part1_2014-02-13.txt

**Warning** : PKB identifiers **must be unique**. If an identifier appears more than once (in one or more PKB file), **only one occurrence** will be considered.

## How is a Knowledge Base used? ##
### ezPAARSE < 2.1.0 ###
When a resource carrying a vendor identifier (_title_id_) is met, the associated knowledge base is built from the KBART files and loaded to memory. ezPAARSE can then link the proprietary identifier with all the metadata available and add it to the access event generated.

### ezPAARSE since 2.1.0 ###
As knowledge bases are growing and take too much place in RAM, ezPAARSE stores them in a mongoDB database and uses it to query the metadata associated with the proprietary identifiers. For that purpose, it runs [CastorJS](https://github.com/castorjs/castor-load) in the background to keep the database and PKB files synchronized. This keeps the memory footprint of ezPAARSE at a minimum, but also requires some time to perform the synchronization, especially on first startup.

Please note that processing logs without waiting for the synchronization to be over may result in incomplete enrichment of the access events.

**Warning** : some ezPAARSE output formats will force you to explicitely ask for some information you are interested in. If you don't, you will only get a minimal set of information as a result. This is the case with the CSV output.
Other output formats, like JSON, will automatically return all the data available.

## PKB-miss ##
When ezPAARSE finds a vendor identifier for which there is no link in the associated PKB, it fills the **PKB-miss** file: similar to a PKB file, it is filled with identifiers for which **no corresponding bibliographic information** was found. It allows for an easier way of identifying where the PKB is lacking, and hence to complete it.

The PKB-miss file is created alongside the original PKB files and is named after the short name for the platform followed by the **.pkb.miss.txt** extension (eg: sd.pkb.miss.txt)
